abstract = {The Internet of Things has brought unprecedented technological innovation to smart homes, but the impact of this change on technology and users is limited and dispersed. Based on a systematic literature review, the present research conducted a quantitative analysis of 2874 papers (published in 2008-2020) obtained from the Web of Science to bridge the research gap. The current research identifies the development status and trends, country distribution, and journal categories in this area. Then, based on the main topics covered by smart homes, we proposed a holistic research framework that integrates the infrastructure layer, the communications technology layer, the data analytics layer, and the user service layer. The framework analyzed wireless sensing networks, communication protocols, and security threats, as well as the activity identification process and user services, highlighting the lack of some degree of integration in this area. This study also discussed the evolution of hot spots in the field of smart homes and summarized potential future research directions. Finally, in the discussion section, this paper summarized the research contribution and compared the main proposed technical solutions. We hope this work will provide a solid basis for research and practical guidance for scholars and developers interested in smart homes based on the Internet of Things.},

abstract = {With the popularization of smart devices and the rapid development of smart voice technology, AI personal assistants (AIPAs) have penetrated deeply into users' lives. Compared with previous years, the accuracy, semantic understanding ability, and wake-up ability of AIPAs have been improved, but the lack of service maturity and the insufficient degree of scene integration have brought users a poor human-computer interaction experience. However, studies have scarcely uncovered the underlying mechanism through which those dark sides of AIPAs exert impacts on users' continuance intention. From the perspective of technostress, the current study proposes a theoretical model for consumers to cope with service failure pressure sources. This article collected 413 questionnaires and conducted an empirical analysis. Results show that negative technical characteristics will affect consumers' psychological responses and ultimately affect consumers' technical exhaustion, satisfaction, and two kinds of continuance intentions (general and partial continuance intentions) through cognitive load. Findings open up new avenues for research by exploring the mechanism of how the service failures of these AIPAs affect consumers' continuance intention through the perspective of technostress.},

abstract = {With the development of emerging science and technology, service robots have attracted more attention from scholars. However, it is still lack of comprehensive analysis of these studies from a quantitative perspective. This paper combines quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze the researches of service robots from the perspective of systematic literature review. Based on the clustering analysis of the co-citation network and the co-word network, this paper identifies the main topics and proposes a research framework of service robots which divides the existing researches into five levels. Then, through the bursts detection, this study analyzes hot spots and development of the researches on service robots. Based on the timeline analysis, this paper divides the evolution of the researches into three stages. Besides, this study analyzes the researches in the last three years to determine the recent research priorities and trends, so as to provide a reference for scholars and managers.},
